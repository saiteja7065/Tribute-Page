      <h3 id="headline">Description:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Early Brilliance:</strong> C.V. Raman, born in Trichinopoly, India (1888), 
          displayed exceptional talent for science from a young age.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Academic Accolades:</strong> He excelled in his studies, securing the first place 
          and gold medal in physics during his B.A. at Presidency College, Madras (1904).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Career Path:</strong> aman joined the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science 
          (IACS) early in his career, a period considered his "golden era" due to his prolific research.
        </li>
        <li><strong>The Raman Effect (1928):</strong> His most defining discovery, the Raman effect, revolutionized 
          our understanding of light-matter interaction. Light scattering provides information about a material's molecular structure.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Nobel Prize Laureate (1930): </strong> The Raman effect earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics for his
           work on the scattering of light.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Leadership in Science:</strong> In 1926, he founded the Indian Journal of Physics, a vital platform 
          for scientific communication.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Shift to Bangalore:</strong> In 1933, Raman became the first Indian director of the 
          Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Academy Advocate:</strong> The same year, he established the prestigious Indian Academy of Sciences, fostering scientific
           collaboration in India.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Raman Research Institute:</strong> Dedicated to furthering research, he founded the Raman 
          Research Institute in Bangalore in 1948.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Beyond Physics:</strong> Raman's work extended beyond physics, influencing fields like chemistry, 
          materials science, and medicine.
        </li>
        <li><strong>National Recognition:</strong> India celebrates National Science Day on February 28th every year 
          in honor of his discovery.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Global Impact: </strong> The Raman effect has found applications in diverse areas, from gemstone
         identification to drug development.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Prolific Author:</strong> Raman authored numerous scientific papers and books, leaving a rich legacy of knowledge.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Enduring Legacy:</strong> C.V. Raman's scientific genius continues to inspire researchers and remains 
          a cornerstone of modern science.
        </li>
      </ul>
        <p>
          Every great discovery begins with an idea, nurtured by the passion to delve deeper into the unknown
        </p>
        <p>-- C.V Raman</p>
